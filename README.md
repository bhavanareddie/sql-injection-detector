## 🔍 Overview

SQL injection remains one of the most prevalent web application vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute malicious SQL statements. This Python tool helps simulate real-world attack detection by scanning Apache-style access logs for SQLi keywords and anomalies.

Whether you're building a custom SOC dashboard, learning log analysis, or exploring network forensics, this project provides a practical introduction to pattern-based intrusion detection.

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Detects basic SQL injection patterns  
✅ Scans standard or custom Apache/Nginx access logs  
✅ Highlights suspicious lines with context  
✅ Easy to modify or extend for learning purposes  
✅ Requires no internet, no database, and no third-party services

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above

---

## 🧱 Limitations

- Only detects basic, known SQL injection payloads  
- May produce false positives (especially for similar non-malicious queries)  
- Does not parse logs from databases or firewalls

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add regex-based matching for advanced payload detection  
- Integrate live log monitoring support  
- Export flagged logs to CSV/JSON  
- Build a basic web interface for visualization
